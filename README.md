# Weather Data

This project aims to answer some questions about weather data from csv files, using Python and Data Engineering.

There are three ways to get to the answers in this repository:

1. Using Jupyter Notebook

2. Event-driven Solution in AWS

3. Batch Solution in AWS

There are some test csv files on folder [test-data](test-data)

___

## 1. Using Jupyter Notebook

The script to get to the answers using Jupyter Notebook is in the folder [notebook](notebook/weather-with-pandas.ipynb).

## 2. Event-driven Solution in AWS

The Python script using in Lambda Function can be found on folder [aws-event-driven](aws-event-driven).
